    <h1>The Gift of the Magi</h1>
    <h2 id="small">by O. Henry</h2>
    <p>A well known American short story that tells the story of the young couple, James and Della Dillingham. 
       The couple has a very little money, but a lot of love and lives in a modest apartment. The couple only have
       two possessions: Jim has a gold pocket watch that belonged to his father and grandfather as a family heirloom,
       while Della has a knee-length long hair. It's Christmas Eve, Della finds herself running out of time to buy
       a Christmas gift for James. But after paying all the bills, Della finds out that she's left with $1.87, so she
       decides to go window shopping to buy what she can afford. She wants to buy a chain for his pocket watch, however
       the prices are not in her range. So she decides to cut off her long hair after standing in front of the mirror and thinking
       and sells it for $20.00, just enough to buy the platinum chain. When James returns home from work, he notices Della
       in a different look. Della confesses to Jim (James) that she cut off her hair and sold it to buy him a chain and as a result
       Jim buys her a colorful hair combs as he sold his pocket watch. The story ends with a comparison of Jim and Della's gifts to the gifts that the Magi, 
       or three wise men, gave to Baby Jesus in the manger in the biblical story of Christmas. 
       The narrator concludes that Jim and Della are far wiser than the Magi because their gifts are gifts of love, 
       and those who give out of love and self-sacrifice are truly wise because they know the value of self-giving love.</p>
